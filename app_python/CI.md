## CI Best Practices

______________________________________________________________________

1. **Commit early, commit often**.
2. **Keep the build green**. Don't skip not working builds.
3. **Build only once**. 
4. **Optimize pipeline stages**.  To get the most out of your CI pipelines, optimize stages so that failures are easy to identify and fix.
5. **Make builds fast and simple**. Focus on keeping builds fast, and the best way to do that is by keeping things as simple as possible.
